# Reelix — design notes

**One self-hosted app for your whole media pipeline: discover, request, search, download, import, and organize movies, TV, books and music.**

Reelix combines six tools into one Rust service with one web UI:

| Replaces | What Reelix does |
|---|---|
| **Radarr** | Monitors movies, searches for releases, grabs them, imports and renames files |
| **Sonarr** | Same for TV: series, seasons, episodes, anime absolute numbering |
| **Prowlarr** | Manages indexers (Torznab/Newznab plus built-in definitions), health checks, rate limits |
| **Jellyseerr** | Discovery and request portal with users, approvals, quotas and media-server login |
| **Readarr** | Monitors authors and books (ebooks and audiobooks), grabs, imports and renames them |
| **Lidarr** | Monitors artists and albums, grabs, imports, tags and renames music |

Running it means **one binary, one database, one config, one login, one API**. You don't have to wire API keys between six apps, keep their state in sync, or run six containers.

> **Status:** Pre-alpha. Movies and TV (M0–M7), books (M8) and music (M9) are implemented, with the gaps listed under [Current Progress](#current-progress). Next up: migration, compatibility and hardening (M10), then the 1.0 release (M11). Nothing has been tested against real indexers, download clients or media servers yet.
>
> **Known issue:** in manual testing, an approved movie request was not searched for automatically and did not move from *Requested* to *Available* after downloading. The cause is still under investigation. See [Current Progress](#current-progress).

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- **Unified.** One process with one data model. Requests, library, indexers and downloads share state natively, so there's no polling between services.
- **Fast and light.** Idle RAM under 100 MB, a cold start under 1 second, and libraries of 10k+ movies and 2k+ series without slowing the UI.
- **Correct.** Release parsing, quality decisions and file imports are deterministic and heavily tested. Reelix must never delete or overwrite a file the user didn't ask it to.
- **Real-time UI.** Queue progress, activity and notifications are pushed over WebSocket, so the UI never refreshes on a timer.
- **Multi-user from day one.** Admins manage the library. Requesters see only discovery and their own requests.
- **API-first.** Everything the UI does goes through a documented, versioned REST API (OpenAPI spec generated from code).
- **Every media type in one place.** Movies, TV, books (ebooks and audiobooks) and music share the same indexers, download clients, profiles, users and request portal.
- **Easy migration.** You can import existing Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Jellyseerr, Readarr and Lidarr setups.
- **Compatible.** Expose Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/Readarr-compatible API shims (later milestones) so tools like Bazarr, Recyclarr, Overseerr clients, LunaSea/nzb360 and Home Assistant keep working.

### Non-Goals (for 1.0)

- Media **playback or streaming**. That's Jellyfin, Plex or Emby's job, and Reelix integrates with them.
- Reading ebooks or streaming audiobooks and music. Calibre-Web, Kavita, Audiobookshelf, Navidrome and the media servers do that, and Reelix integrates with them.
- Comics and manga (Mylar/Kapowarr territory). The data model shouldn't rule them out.
- A built-in torrent or Usenet client. Reelix talks to existing download clients.
- Subtitle management (Bazarr). Possibly post-1.0.
- Transcoding.

## Feature Overview

### Library Management (Radarr + Sonarr)
- Add movies and series by search, TMDB/TVDB/IMDb ID, list import, or request approval.
- Monitoring modes:
  - Movies: monitored / unmonitored, minimum availability (announced, in cinemas, released).
  - Series: all, future, missing, existing, first season, latest season, pilot, none. Monitoring can also be set per season or per episode.
- Series types: **Standard**, **Daily**, **Anime** (absolute numbering, scene/XEM mappings).
- Root folders, a storage overview and free-space checks.
- Library scanning that detects existing files, plus a filesystem watcher for changes.
- Automatic **rename and organize** using tokenized naming templates.
- **Hardlink / atomic move / copy** imports. Hardlinks are the default when source and destination share a filesystem, so seeding can continue.
- Recycle bin with retention instead of hard deletes.
- Calendar of upcoming releases plus an iCal feed.
- Wanted views: missing items, and items that haven't reached their quality cutoff.
- Tags that link items to profiles, indexers, download clients and notifications.

### Quality & Decision Engine
- **Quality definitions** (SDTV through Remux-2160p) with size limits per minute of runtime.
- **Quality profiles** with ordered qualities, grouped qualities, an upgrade cutoff and an "upgrades allowed" toggle.
- **Custom formats**: regex or conditions on title, release group, source, resolution, codec, HDR format, audio, language, edition, indexer flags and size, each with a score.
- Custom format score thresholds: a minimum score and an upgrade-until score.
- **Language profiles** (folded into quality profiles, as in Sonarr v4).
- Delay profiles (prefer Usenet or torrent, wait N minutes for a better release).
- Release restrictions (must contain / must not contain).
- Blocklist covering failed downloads and manual entries.
- **Recyclarr/TRaSH-guide compatible** import of custom formats and profiles (JSON).

### Indexer Management (Prowlarr)
- Native **Torznab** and **Newznab** support.
- Built-in **indexer definitions** in YAML, aiming for compatibility with the Cardigann/Jackett/Prowlarr definition format so the community catalog can be reused.
- Rate limiting, back-off and automatic disable/re-enable on failure.
- Health checks and statistics: queries, grabs, failures and response time per indexer.
- Per-indexer categories, tags, priority and seed ratio/time.
- Proxies: HTTP, SOCKS5 and FlareSolverr for Cloudflare-protected sites.
- A manual **multi-indexer search** page, like Prowlarr's search.
- Optional: expose Reelix as a Torznab/Newznab **aggregator endpoint** for external tools.

### Download Clients
- **Torrent:** qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, rTorrent/ruTorrent, a blackhole folder.
- **Usenet:** SABnzbd (first-class, see [SABnzbd spec](#sabnzbd-usenet)), NZBGet, a blackhole folder.
- Per-client category or label, priority, and tags.
- Completed-download handling: automatic import, remove after seeding goals are met.
- Failed-download handling: blocklist the release, then search again automatically.
- Remote path mappings for clients that run on another host or container.

### Requests & Discovery (Jellyseerr)
- A discovery home page with trending, popular, upcoming, by genre, by network or studio, and "because you watched".
- Search across TMDB that shows availability: available, partially available, requested, pending or processing.
- Request a movie, a whole series, or specific seasons. Advanced requests let a user pick a profile or root folder when they have permission.
- Approval workflow with auto-approve per user or role, and manual approve/decline with a reason.
- **Quotas**: N movies or N seasons per X days, per user.
- Login with **Jellyfin, Emby or Plex** accounts as well as local accounts and optional OIDC.
- Users can report issues on available media (audio, video, subtitles, other) and admins resolve them.
- Watchlist sync from Plex/Jellyfin, plus a request-from-watchlist option.
- Request books (ebook and/or audiobook) and albums from the same portal, with their own quotas and auto-approve permissions.
- User notification preferences such as "notify me when my request is available".

### Books (Readarr) — *M8*
- Add authors (monitor all, future or selected books) or single books, by search, ISBN, ASIN or list import.
- Ebooks and audiobooks as separate formats of one book, each with its own quality profile and root folder (for example `epub > azw3 > pdf`, and `m4b > mp3` for audiobooks).
- Editions, series (reading order) and multi-author books.
- Release parsing for book and audiobook releases: author, title, series, format, narrator, bitrate, "unabridged".
- Import with embedded metadata and cover writing (EPUB OPF, M4B tags), multi-file audiobook handling, and an optional Calibre library as the destination.
- Naming templates with author, series and book tokens.
- Metadata from Open Library (default), with Google Books and Hardcover as optional sources.

### Music (Lidarr) — *M9*
- Add artists (monitor all, future, missing or selected albums) or single albums, by search, MusicBrainz ID or list import (Last.fm, Spotify playlists, ListenBrainz).
- Release groups vs. releases (editions), with filters for primary and secondary album types (album, EP, single, live, compilation…).
- Quality profiles for audio: lossy and lossless tiers (MP3 320, AAC, FLAC 16/24-bit), and a preferred-release score.
- Release parsing for music releases: artist, album, year, format, bitrate, source (CD, WEB, vinyl), and "discography" packs.
- Import with track matching against MusicBrainz (track count, duration, tag fingerprints), tag writing, cover art and multi-disc folders.
- Naming templates with artist, album, disc and track tokens.
- Metadata from MusicBrainz and the Cover Art Archive.

### Media Server Integration
- **Jellyfin, Emby, Plex**: trigger a library refresh after import and sync availability.
- Optionally pull watch history to drive recommendations and cleanup rules.
- **Audiobookshelf, Kavita, Calibre-Web, Navidrome**: library refresh after book and music imports (Calibre-Web: best-effort reconnect).

### Notifications
- Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email (SMTP), Pushover, Gotify, ntfy, Apprise, Matrix, generic webhooks and custom scripts.
- Events: grab, import, upgrade, rename, delete, health issue, request created/approved/declined/available, issue reported/resolved, application update.

### Lists & Automation
- Import lists: TMDB lists/collections/popular, Trakt, IMDb lists, Plex/Jellyfin watchlists, MDBList, other Reelix instances.
- Collections (movie franchises) with "monitor whole collection".
- Optional cleanup rules, such as removing watched content after N days (opt-in, with dry-run).

### System
- Health page (indexers failing, clients unreachable, disk space, permissions, update available).
- Task scheduler UI showing run time, next run and manual trigger.
- Event log and activity history.
- Backups: scheduled and manual, as a ZIP of the DB and config, with restore.
- Updates: in-app notice, plus a Docker tag strategy.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | **Rust (stable, edition 2021+)** | Performance, memory safety, single static binary |
| Async runtime | **tokio** | Ecosystem standard |
| HTTP server | **axum** | Tower middleware, ergonomic extractors, WebSocket support |
| HTTP client | **reqwest** (rustls) | Indexers, metadata, download clients |
| Database | **SQLite** (default) via **sqlx**; **PostgreSQL** optional | Zero-config for home users, Postgres for large or shared setups |
| Migrations | `sqlx migrate` (embedded in binary) | Migrations run at startup |
| Serialization | **serde**, serde_json, quick-xml (Torznab/Newznab RSS) | |
| Frontend | **Leptos** (Rust → WASM, client-side rendered, bundled with **Trunk**) and served by axum as static files | Whole stack in Rust with shared types between API and UI; CSR keeps the UI a pure API client |
| Styling | Hand-written CSS with design tokens (CSS custom properties) | No Node toolchain; dark mode first, light theme override |
| API docs | **utoipa** → OpenAPI 3.1 + Scalar/Swagger UI at `/api/docs` | Generated from handler types |
| Auth | argon2id (passwords), DB-backed session cookies (hashed tokens), hashed API keys, `openidconnect` (OIDC, M6) | |
| Scheduling | Internal scheduler on tokio + a persistent job table | Survives restarts; visible in UI |
| Release parsing | Custom parser crate (`regex` + `nom` where needed) | Core IP; needs exhaustive tests |
| Media info | `ffprobe` (bundled in Docker image) | Codec, resolution, HDR, audio tracks, runtime |
| Audio tags *(M8/M9)* | **lofty** | Read and write ID3, Vorbis, FLAC, MP4/M4B tags for music and audiobooks |
| Ebook metadata *(M8)* | EPUB OPF via `zip` + quick-xml | Read and write title, author, series, ISBN, cover |
| Book / music metadata *(M8/M9)* | Open Library (+ optional Google Books, Hardcover); MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive | Free, open sources with stable IDs; MusicBrainz is rate-limited to 1 req/s, so results are cached aggressively |
| FS watching | **notify** | Detect manual changes in library |
| Templating (naming) | Custom token engine | Sonarr/Radarr-compatible tokens |
| Logging/tracing | **tracing**, tracing-subscriber, optional OpenTelemetry export | |
| Metrics | Prometheus endpoint (`metrics` + `metrics-exporter-prometheus`) | |
| Config | **figment** (TOML file + env vars + CLI flags) | |
| Error handling | `thiserror` (libraries), `anyhow` (binary edges) | |

> **Frontend alternative:** If Leptos becomes a bottleneck (component ecosystem, dev velocity), the fallback is a TypeScript SPA (SvelteKit or React + Vite) served by axum as static files. The API-first design keeps this swap cheap. **Decision: start with Leptos (CSR) and revisit at the end of M1.** SSR + hydration was considered and deferred: CSR avoids coupling the server binary to the UI build, and the server already injects `<base href>` for `url_base` and a hash-based CSP for the Trunk loader script.

### Architectural Principles

1. **Modular monolith.** One deployable binary, split internally into crates with clear boundaries. Each domain crate exposes a service trait, and the server crate wires them together.
2. **Hexagonal / ports & adapters.** Every external system (indexer, download client, metadata provider, media server, notifier) is a **trait** with multiple adapters. Adding a new download client means adding one adapter file plus a settings schema.
3. **Event-driven side effects.** Core operations emit domain events (`MovieGrabbed`, `EpisodeImported`, `RequestApproved`, …). Notifications, media-server refreshes, WebSocket pushes and history logging all subscribe to events instead of being called directly.
4. **Persistent jobs.** Long or retryable work (searches, imports, refreshes) goes through a DB-backed job queue with retries, back-off and deduplication, so a crash mid-import resumes safely.
5. **Dynamic provider settings.** Each adapter declares its settings schema (fields, types, validation, help text). The UI renders the forms generically, so new providers need no frontend work.
6. **Shared types.** Request/response DTOs live in `reelix-api-types`, which the server and the Leptos frontend both compile. API and UI can't drift.

### Key Traits (sketch)

    async fn notify(&self, event: &DomainEvent) -> Result<(), NotifyError>;
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait MediaServer: Send + Sync {
    async fn authenticate(&self, creds: &Credentials) -> Result<ExternalUser, MsError>;
    async fn refresh(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<(), MsError>;
    async fn library_items(&self) -> Result<Vec<MsItem>, MsError>;
}
```

## Core Pipelines

### 1. Release Parsing (`reelix-parser`)

Input: `Show.Name.S02E05.1080p.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.Atmos.H.264-GROUP`

Output:

```rust
ParsedRelease {
    title: "Show Name",
    year: None,
    kind: Episode { season: 2, episodes: [5], absolute: [], air_date: None, full_season: false },
    quality: Quality { source: WebDl, resolution: R1080p, modifier: None },
    revision: Revision { version: 1, real: 0, proper: false, repack: false },
    languages: [English],
    release_group: Some("GROUP"),
    edition: None,
    hdr: [], video_codec: Some(H264), audio: [DDP 5.1, Atmos],
    hash: None,
}
```

Requirements:
- Handles movies, standard TV, multi-episode (S01E01E02, S01E01-E03), full seasons, multi-season packs, daily (2024.05.01), anime (`[Group] Show - 1052 [1080p]`), specials, and foreign titles and languages.
- Detects PROPER/REPACK/REAL/v2, editions (Director's Cut, Extended, IMAX…), HDR (DV, HDR10, HDR10+, HLG), 3D, remux, BR-DISK.
- A **fixture-driven test suite** of 5,000+ real titles with expected output is a blocking CI gate.
- Pure and synchronous, with no I/O. It's fuzz-tested (`cargo fuzz`) so it never panics.

### 2. Search → Grab

```
Trigger (RSS sync | missing search | manual | new request approved | upgrade)
   │
   ▼
Build SearchCriteria (titles + aliases, year, IDs, seasons/eps, scene mappings)
   │
   ▼
Indexer Manager ── fan-out (concurrent, per-indexer rate limits) ──► Torznab/Newznab/YAML
   │   collects ReleaseInfo[], records stats/failures
   ▼
Parse each release → map to Movie / Episodes (by IDs first, then title matching)
   │
   ▼
Decision Engine: run Specifications
   ├─ Not blocklisted            ├─ Quality allowed by profile
   ├─ Size within limits         ├─ Custom format score ≥ min
   ├─ Is upgrade over existing   ├─ Release/restriction rules
   ├─ Not already in queue       ├─ Minimum availability / air date
   ├─ Seeders / age / retention  ├─ Delay profile
   └─ Language matches           └─ Indexer & tag constraints
   │  → Accepted / Rejected(reasons[]) (reasons shown in interactive search)
   ▼
Prioritize accepted: quality ▸ CF score ▸ protocol pref ▸ indexer priority ▸ seeders/age ▸ size
   │
   ▼
Send to DownloadClient (chosen by protocol, tags, priority) → create queue_item
   │
   ▼
Emit `ReleaseGrabbed` → history, notifications, WS push, request status = Processing
```

### 3. Download Tracking → Import

```
Every 30–60s: poll each download client → reconcile with queue_items
   │
   ├─ downloading → update progress (WS push)
   ├─ failed      → blocklist + emit DownloadFailed + (optional) re-search
   └─ completed   →
         │
         ▼
   Resolve local path (remote path mappings)
   │
   ▼
   Find media files (ignore samples, extras rules), ffprobe each
   │
   ▼
   Match files → episodes/movie (parse filename + folder + tracked release)
   │
   ▼
   Import Specifications: is upgrade, free space, not sample, matches expected, unpack done…
   │
   ▼
   Execute: hardlink (default if same FS) | atomic move | copy  →  rename via template
   │       old file → recycle bin (if upgrade)
   ▼
   DB update (files, history) → Emit `MediaImported` / `MediaUpgraded`
   │
   ▼
   Subscribers: media-server refresh, notifications, request → Available, WS push
   │
   ▼
   Post-import: client-side removal once seed goals met (if enabled)
```

If an import can't be matched automatically (ambiguous or unknown), the item lands in **Manual Import** with the reasons attached.

### 4. Request Lifecycle

```
User requests media
   │
   ├─ Quota check ──► exceeded → reject with message
   ▼
status = Pending ── auto-approve permission? ──yes──┐
   │ no                                             │
   ▼                                                ▼
Admin approves/declines (with reason)         status = Approved
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                         Create/Update Movie or Series (monitor requested seasons)
                         using default or overridden profile + root folder
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                    Trigger search job → status = Processing
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                    MediaImported for all requested items → status = Available
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                    Notify requester (per-user preferences)
```

Because the library and requests share a database, **availability is always exact**. There's no "sync with Radarr" lag.

### 5. Naming Engine

Sonarr/Radarr-compatible tokens so users can paste existing formats:

```
Movie folder:   {Movie CleanTitle} ({Release Year}) {tmdb-{TmdbId}}
Movie file:     {Movie CleanTitle} ({Release Year}) {edition-{Edition Tags}} [{Custom Formats}][{Quality Full}][{MediaInfo VideoDynamicRangeType}]{-Release Group}
Series folder:  {Series TitleYear} {tvdb-{TvdbId}}
Season folder:  Season {season:00}
Episode file:   {Series TitleYear} - S{season:00}E{episode:00} - {Episode CleanTitle} [{Quality Full}]{-Release Group}
Anime file:     {Series TitleYear} - S{season:00}E{episode:00} - {absolute:000} - {Episode CleanTitle} [{Quality Full}]{-Release Group}
```

Includes a live preview in settings, illegal-character replacement, colon handling options, and a max path length guard.

Books and music get their own Readarr/Lidarr-compatible tokens:

```
Author folder:  {Author Name}
Book file:      {Author Name} - {Book Series}{ #{Book SeriesPosition}} - {Book Title} ({Release Year})
Artist folder:  {Artist Name}
Album folder:   {Album Title} ({Release Year}) [{Quality Title}]
Track file:     {medium:0}{track:00} - {Track Title}
```

### 6. Books & Music *(M8/M9)*

Books and music reuse the same pipelines (search → decision → grab → track → import) with media-specific pieces plugged in:

- **Parsing:** separate parser modules for book/audiobook and music release names, with their own fixture suites. TV and movie parsing is untouched.
- **Matching:** books match by ISBN/ASIN first, then author + title. Albums match by MusicBrainz release (track count and durations), with a manual "choose release" step when the match is ambiguous.
- **Decision:** quality profiles gain `media_kind = book | audiobook | music` with their own quality lists. Custom formats and delay profiles work unchanged.
- **Import:** multi-file units (an album or a multi-part audiobook) import atomically: all files or none. Tags and covers are written after import, never to files still seeding.

## Download Client Integrations

Every client is an adapter implementing the `DownloadClient` trait in `reelix-downloaders`, and each one declares its own settings schema. This section is the detailed spec for each adapter.

### SABnzbd (Usenet)

**Crate module:** `reelix-downloaders/src/sabnzbd/` (`mod.rs`, `api.rs`, `models.rs`, `health.rs`)
**Protocol:** Usenet · **Supported versions:** SABnzbd **3.0+** (tested against the latest 3.x and 4.x) · **Milestone:** M4, as the first Usenet client to ship.

#### Settings Schema

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | `SABnzbd` | Display name. Multiple instances are allowed. |
| `host` | string | `localhost` | Hostname, IP or container name |
| `port` | u16 | `8080` | |
| `use_ssl` | bool | `false` | `verify_ssl` toggle shown when on |
| `url_base` | string | `/sabnzbd` | Matches SABnzbd's `url_base` setting |
| `api_key` | secret | — | Must be the **full API key**. The NZB key can only add jobs, so it's rejected. |
| `username` / `password` | secret | — | Only if SABnzbd sits behind HTTP basic auth |
| `movie_category` | string | `movies` | Picked from a dropdown filled by `mode=get_cats` |
| `tv_category` | string | `tv` | |
| `recent_priority` | enum | `Default` | Applies to releases aired or released in the last 14 days: Default / Paused / Low / Normal / High / Force |
| `older_priority` | enum | `Default` | Applies to everything else |
| `grab_method` | enum | `upload_nzb` | `upload_nzb` (Reelix fetches the NZB and uploads it) or `send_url` |
| `priority` | u8 | `1` | Client priority when several Usenet clients match |
| `remove_completed` / `remove_failed` | bool | `true` / `true` | Remove from SABnzbd history after import or failure handling |
| `tags` | tag[] | — | Limits this client to tagged media |

The API key and password are encrypted at rest like every other provider secret.

#### API Mapping

All calls go to `GET|POST {scheme}://{host}:{port}{url_base}/api?apikey=…&output=json&mode=…`.

| Reelix operation | SABnzbd call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `test()` | `mode=version`, then `mode=get_config` and `mode=get_cats` | Checks connectivity, the minimum version, a valid full API key and that the configured categories exist |
| `add()`, upload | `POST mode=addfile` (multipart `name` = NZB bytes) with `cat`, `priority`, `nzbname` | Default. The indexer's API key never reaches SABnzbd, and Reelix can validate the NZB (non-empty, parseable XML) before sending it. |
| `add()`, URL | `mode=addurl&name=<nzb url>` with `cat`, `priority`, `nzbname` | Fallback for indexers whose NZB links SABnzbd must fetch itself |
| `items()` | `mode=queue&cat=<category>` + `mode=history&category=<category>&limit=<n>` | Merged into one list. **Only Reelix's categories are read**, so other downloads in SABnzbd are never touched. |
| `remove()` | `mode=queue&name=delete&value=<nzo_id>&del_files=<0/1>` or `mode=history&name=delete&value=<nzo_id>&del_files=<0/1>&archive=0` | Queue vs. history is decided by where the item currently is |
| Change priority | `mode=queue&name=priority&value=<nzo_id>&value2=<prio>` | Exposed in the Queue screen |
| Health and warnings | `mode=get_config&section=misc`, `mode=warnings` | Feeds the health checks below |

The SABnzbd `nzo_id` returned by `add()` (for example `SABnzbd_nzo_abc123`) is stored as `queue_items.download_id`. Priority values map to SABnzbd as Default `-100`, Paused `-2`, Low `-1`, Normal `0`, High `1`, Force `2`.

#### Status Mapping

| SABnzbd state | Source | Reelix `DownloadState` |
|---|---|---|
| `Queued`, `Grabbing`, `Fetching`, `Propagating` | queue | `Queued` |
| `Downloading` | queue | `Downloading` (progress = `1 - mbleft/mb`, ETA from `timeleft`) |
| `Paused`, or global queue paused | queue | `Paused` |
| `Checking`, `QuickCheck`, `Verifying`, `Repairing`, `Extracting`, `Moving`, `Running` | history | `PostProcessing`. Reelix never imports before SABnzbd finishes. |
| `Completed` | history | `Completed`. Output path = history `storage` field, then remote path mapping. |
| `Failed` | history | `Failed` with `fail_message` attached |

Failure reasons are classified from `fail_message` so the right action is taken:

| Failure | Action |
|---|---|
| Missing articles, repair failed, unpacking failed | Blocklist the release, then search again if enabled |
| Encrypted or password-protected archive | Blocklist with reason "password protected", then search again |
| Out of disk space, or the job was aborted for being too large | **No blocklist** (not the release's fault); raise a health warning |
| NZB fetch failed / duplicate rejected by SABnzbd | Mark the grab as failed, blocklist, then search again |

#### Import Behaviour

- Once the history status is `Completed`, the `storage` path is resolved through **remote path mappings** and handed to the normal import pipeline (hardlink/move/copy + rename).
- Usenet downloads have no seeding, so after a successful import Reelix moves the files by default and removes the history entry when `remove_completed` is on.
- If `storage` doesn't exist locally, the item goes to **Manual Import** with a "path not found" warning instead of failing silently.

#### Health Checks

Each check is shown on **System → Health** with a link to the relevant SABnzbd setting:

- SABnzbd is unreachable, or the API key is invalid or only an NZB key.
- The version is below the supported minimum.
- A configured category doesn't exist in SABnzbd.
- **Sorting is enabled** for a Reelix category (TV, movie or date sorting in SABnzbd). Sorting renames files before Reelix can match them.
- History retention is set to delete immediately, so Reelix can't see completed jobs.
- A category's completed folder isn't reachable locally and no remote path mapping covers it.
- SABnzbd reports a server or disk warning through `mode=warnings`.

#### UI

- **Settings → Download Clients → Add → SABnzbd:** the schema-driven form, a **Test** button that reports each check separately (connect, auth, version, categories), and category dropdowns filled live from SABnzbd.
- **Activity → Queue:** shows SABnzbd items with progress, ETA, post-processing stage (for example "Repairing" or "Extracting"), and actions to change priority, remove, or remove and blocklist.

#### Adapter Sketch

```rust
pub struct Sabnzbd {
    http: reqwest::Client,
    settings: SabnzbdSettings,
}

#[async_trait]
impl DownloadClient for Sabnzbd {
    fn protocol(&self) -> Protocol { Protocol::Usenet }

    async fn add(&self, release: &RemoteRelease, opts: &AddOptions) -> Result<DownloadId, ClientError> {
        let category = self.settings.category_for(opts.media_kind);
        let priority = self.settings.priority_for(opts.is_recent);
        let resp: AddResponse = match self.settings.grab_method {
            GrabMethod::UploadNzb => self.add_file(&release.nzb_bytes().await?, &release.title, category, priority).await?,
            GrabMethod::SendUrl   => self.add_url(&release.download_url, &release.title, category, priority).await?,
        };
        resp.nzo_ids.into_iter().next()
            .map(DownloadId::from)
            .ok_or(ClientError::Rejected("SABnzbd returned no nzo_id".into()))
    }

    async fn items(&self) -> Result<Vec<DownloadItem>, ClientError> {
        let (queue, history) = tokio::try_join!(self.queue(), self.history())?;
        Ok(queue.into_iter().map(Into::into).chain(history.into_iter().map(Into::into)).collect())
    }

    async fn remove(&self, id: &DownloadId, delete_data: bool) -> Result<(), ClientError> { /* queue or history delete */ }
    async fn test(&self) -> Result<(), ClientError> { /* version → config → categories */ }
}
```

#### Tests

- `wiremock` fixtures recorded from real SABnzbd 3.x and 4.x responses covering version, get_config, get_cats, addfile, addurl, queue, history and the failure messages above.
- Unit tests for the status mapping and failure classification tables.
- An end-to-end test (compose stack) that grabs from the mock Newznab indexer through a real SABnzbd container to an imported, renamed file.

### Compatibility Shims (M10)

- `/api/v3/*` Radarr- and Sonarr-shaped subsets (separate namespaces via `/radarr/api/v3` and `/sonarr/api/v3`) for Bazarr, Recyclarr, Homepage, LunaSea/nzb360 and so on.
- `/torznab/{indexerId}/api` exposes Reelix's indexers to external tools.
- `/readarr/api/v1` and `/lidarr/api/v1` subsets for book and music tools.

## Web UI & Screens

Design language: **dark-first**, responsive (desktop, tablet and phone), poster-grid and table views, keyboard shortcuts (`/` search, `g m` movies, `g s` series, `g q` queue), and real-time updates over WebSocket. The UI is split into an **Admin/Library** area and a **Request** area. Requesters see only the Request area.

### Navigation Map

### UI Component Library (Leptos)

These shared components live in `reelix-web/src/components`: `PosterCard`, `PosterGrid` (virtualized), `DataTable` (sortable, selectable, virtualized, column chooser), `ProviderForm` (renders from schema), `Modal`, `Drawer`, `Toast`, `ProgressBar`, `StatusBadge`, `QualityBadge`, `TagInput`, `SeasonPicker`, `CalendarView`, `Chart` (wrapping a lightweight chart lib), `LogViewer`, `ConfirmDialog`, `EmptyState`, `Skeleton`.

Internationalization uses `leptos_i18n` with Fluent-style message files, English first.

## Users, Roles & Permissions

Permissions are **bitflags**. Roles are presets that you can customize per user.

| Permission | Admin | Manager | Power User | User |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| ADMIN (everything, settings, system) | ✓ | | | |
| MANAGE_LIBRARY (add/edit/delete media, search, grab) | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| MANAGE_REQUESTS (approve/decline/edit) | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| MANAGE_USERS | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| MANAGE_ISSUES | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| REQUEST_MOVIE / REQUEST_TV | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| REQUEST_4K | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| REQUEST_ADVANCED (choose profile/root) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| AUTO_APPROVE (movie / tv / 4k) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| VIEW_REQUESTS (all users) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| CREATE_ISSUES | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| VIEW_CALENDAR / VIEW_QUEUE | ✓ | ✓ | opt | opt |
| REQUEST_BOOK / REQUEST_MUSIC | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | opt |

"opt" means off in the preset, but it can be ticked per user. VIEW_CALENDAR opens the calendar, and VIEW_QUEUE opens a read-only download queue. Managing queue items still needs MANAGE_LIBRARY.

Permissions are enforced in the **service layer**, not just in handlers or the UI.

---

## Configuration

Precedence: **CLI flags > environment variables > `config.toml` > defaults.** Most settings live in the database and are edited in the UI. The config file covers bootstrap options only.

```toml
# /config/config.toml
[server]
bind = "0.0.0.0"
port = 7700
url_base = ""            # e.g. "/reelix" behind a reverse proxy

[database]
url = "sqlite:///config/reelix.db"   # or postgres://user:pass@host/reelix

[paths]
data_dir = "/config"
backup_dir = "/config/backups"
log_dir = "/config/logs"

[security]
# Used for encrypting provider secrets at rest; auto-generated on first run if absent
secret_key_file = "/config/secret.key"
trusted_proxies = ["172.16.0.0/12"]

[logging]
level = "info"           # trace | debug | info | warn | error
format = "pretty"        # pretty | json
```

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `REELIX_PORT`, `REELIX_BIND`, `REELIX_URL_BASE` | Server |
| `REELIX_DATABASE_URL` | DB connection |
| `REELIX_DATA_DIR` | Config/data root |
| `REELIX_SECRET_KEY` | Overrides key file |
| `REELIX_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging |
| `REELIX_TMDB_API_KEY` | Optional own TMDB key (a default app key ships) |
| `PUID`, `PGID`, `UMASK`, `TZ` | Docker conventions |

---

## Deployment

### Docker (primary)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  reelix:
    image: ghcr.io/reelix/reelix:latest
    container_name: reelix
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /data:/data           # single mount containing torrents/, usenet/, media/ → enables hardlinks
    ports:
      - "7700:7700"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Recommended folder structure** (so hardlinks and atomic moves work):

```
/data
├── torrents/{movies,tv,books,music}
├── usenet/{movies,tv,books,music}
└── media/{movies,tv,books,audiobooks,music}
```

### Native binaries

Native binaries are built for `x86_64` and `aarch64` on Linux (musl, static), Windows and macOS. They ship with a systemd unit, a Windows service wrapper and a launchd plist. `ffprobe` must be on `PATH` (the Docker image bundles it).

### Reverse proxy

Reelix supports `url_base`, `X-Forwarded-*` headers from trusted proxies and WebSocket upgrades. The docs include example configs for Nginx, Caddy, Traefik and SWAG.

### Image

The image is a multi-stage build (`cargo chef` for layer caching) on a distroless or Alpine base with ffprobe. The target size is under 80 MB.

---

## Migrating from the *arr Stack

`reelix-migrate` (UI: **Settings → Import from…**, CLI: `reelix migrate --from radarr --url … --api-key …`):

| Source | Imported |
|---|---|
| Radarr | Movies (with file records and paths, no file moves), quality profiles, custom formats, naming, root folders, tags, download clients, notifications, history (optional), blocklist |
| Sonarr | Series, seasons and episode monitoring, episode files, profiles, CFs, naming, tags, clients, notifications, history (optional) |
| Prowlarr | Indexers (definitions and settings), proxies, tags, app sync is discarded |
| Jellyseerr / Overseerr | Users (with media-server links), requests (with status), issues, request settings, quotas |
| Readarr | Authors, books and monitoring, book files, quality/metadata profiles, naming, root folders, tags |
| Lidarr | Artists, albums (with chosen releases) and monitoring, track files, quality/metadata profiles, naming, root folders, tags |

The import runs through the **API** of the running source app, with a fallback that reads the SQLite DB directly. It includes a dry-run report with conflicts and is idempotent, so it's safe to re-run.

---

## Current Progress

*Last updated 2026-10-29.*

**Working (movies and TV, M0–M7):** setup wizard, login and users; quality profiles, custom formats and the decision engine; movie and series libraries with scan, import, rename and metadata refresh; Torznab/Newznab indexers with health, stats and manual search; SABnzbd, NZBGet, qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge and blackhole clients; the search → grab → track → import pipeline with manual import, history and blocklist; calendar and iCal feed; discovery, requests, approvals, quotas and issues; Jellyfin/Emby/Plex login and refresh; eleven notifiers; import lists and watchlist sync.

**Working (books and music, M8–M9):** authors, books, editions and series with separate ebook/audiobook monitoring, profiles and root folders; artists, albums, release choice and tracks with metadata profiles; Open Library and MusicBrainz/Cover Art Archive metadata (rate-limited and cached); book and music release parsers (175 and 281 fixtures, 100% pass); ebook, audiobook and music quality families with default profiles and size limits; book/music indexer categories and search modes, and book/music download-client categories; automatic, RSS and interactive search, grab, tracking, atomic import with EPUB/M4B/audio tag and cover writing (copying instead of hardlinking when tags are written), history and blocklist; library scan, import and rename; book and album requests with formats, quotas and auto-approve; Audiobookshelf, Kavita, Calibre-Web and Navidrome refresh; Last.fm, ListenBrainz and Spotify import lists.

**Recently fixed:**
- The VIEW_CALENDAR and VIEW_QUEUE permissions now work for non-manager users (power users and users). Before, the calendar and queue were only reachable with MANAGE_LIBRARY.
- The dashboard's "Getting started" card can be closed. The choice is remembered per browser.

**Known issues:**
- An approved movie request was not searched for automatically, and its request did not move from *Requested* to *Available* after the download finished. The approval code does queue a search and the status sync runs every 15 minutes, so the cause is not yet known. Investigating needs the server log or database from an affected run.

**Open gaps in finished milestones:**
- Parser: 624 fixtures (100% pass) against a 2,000 target, and no `cargo fuzz` target yet.
- Indexers: the YAML definition engine works, but no definitions ship yet.
- TV: the XEM/scene-mapping sync job isn't written.
- Notifications: per-user preferences are stored, but request notifications still go to every notifier.
- Requests: 4K availability isn't tracked separately.
- CI and the Docker image are written but haven't run in CI yet.
- Nothing has been tested against real indexers, download clients or media servers.

**Gaps in books and music:**
- No manual import for book or album downloads; failed imports can be retried from the queue.
- Calibre-Web can only be reconnected (best effort); Audiobookshelf and Kavita rescan whole libraries.
- Spotify list items match by name only; there are no book import lists.
- Discover shows artists as chips without an album browser; there's no bulk approve for book/album requests.
- Metadata is cached in memory only, so a restart refetches from MusicBrainz at 1 request/second.
- YAML-definition indexers always use the default book/music categories.
- Scene music names with hyphenated artists (for example "Alt-J") split wrongly.
- None of it has been tested against real indexers, download clients, media servers or a large real library, so the M8/M9 exit criteria are unverified.

**Not started:** M10 (`reelix-migrate` is a placeholder, and there are no API shims, no Torznab aggregator, no PostgreSQL support, and the Backup and Updates pages are placeholders).

---

## Milestones & Roadmap

Each milestone ends with a tagged pre-release and a working Docker image. Books and music come next, so migration, compatibility and hardening (M10) cover all six tools in one pass.

### M0 — Foundation *(weeks 1–3)*
- [x] Cargo workspace, CI (fmt, clippy -D warnings, test, cargo-deny, cargo-audit), Docker build
- [x] `reelix-core` entities and events; `reelix-db` with SQLite migrations and repository pattern
- [x] axum server, config loading (figment), tracing, graceful shutdown
- [x] Auth: local users, argon2, sessions, API keys; setup-wizard API
- [x] Persistent job queue and scheduler skeleton
- [x] Event bus and WebSocket hub
- [x] Leptos app shell: layout, nav, login, setup wizard, theme, toasts
- [x] OpenAPI generation and `/api/docs`

**Status: ✅ complete.** Docker image and CI workflow are written but not yet run in CI.

**Exit criteria:** A user can install via Docker, complete the setup wizard, log in and see an empty dashboard. CI is green.

### M1 — Release Parser & Decision Engine *(weeks 3–6)*
- [ ] `reelix-parser` with 2,000+ fixture titles (movies + TV + anime), fuzzing — *624 fixtures (100% pass) + a never-panic test; still short of 2,000, and no `cargo fuzz` target yet*
- [x] Quality definitions and quality profiles (CRUD + UI editor)
- [x] Custom formats with all specification types, a "test release name" tool, TRaSH JSON import
- [x] Delay profiles, release profiles, blocklist model
- [x] Specification framework that returns structured rejection reasons

**Status: ✅ done** except the larger fixture corpus and fuzz target.

**Exit criteria:** Pasting any release name in the UI shows the parsed fields, matched CFs, score and accept/reject result against a profile. Fixture pass rate is at least 99%.

### M2 — Movies Core (Radarr parity, part 1) *(weeks 6–10)*
- [x] TMDB metadata provider with caching and rate limiting
- [x] Root folders, add movie, movie library (grid/table, filters, bulk edit), movie detail
- [x] Library scan and import of existing folders; ffprobe media info
- [x] Naming engine with movie tokens and preview; rename
- [x] Refresh-metadata job; collections

**Status: ✅ done.** Not yet measured against a real 1,000-movie library.

**Exit criteria:** A user can import an existing 1,000-movie library, see correct metadata and file info, and rename files safely, with the preview matching the result.

### M3 — Indexers (Prowlarr parity) *(weeks 9–13)*
- [x] Torznab and Newznab adapters (caps, search modes, categories)
- [x] YAML definition engine (Cardigann-compatible subset: login, search paths, selectors, filters) — *no definitions shipped yet (drop files into `{data_dir}/definitions`); pagination, `rows.after`/`dateheaders` not supported*
- [x] Rate limiting, back-off, health and stats
- [x] Proxy and FlareSolverr support
- [x] Indexer UI: catalog, add/test, stats charts, manual multi-indexer search
- [x] RSS sync job

**Status: ✅ engine and UI done.** The "50 definitions" exit criterion is not met: no definitions ship yet.

**Exit criteria:** At least 50 popular public and private definitions pass the test suite with recorded fixtures, and manual search works across five or more indexers concurrently.

### M4 — Download Clients & Import Pipeline *(weeks 12–16)*
- [x] **SABnzbd adapter** (full spec in [Download Client Integrations](#sabnzbd-usenet)): add via upload/URL, queue + history tracking, failure classification, health checks
- [x] qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, NZBGet, blackhole adapters
- [x] Search → decision → grab flow; interactive search UI with rejection reasons
- [x] Queue tracking, completed and failed download handling, remote path mappings
- [x] Import: hardlink/move/copy, upgrades, recycle bin, permissions
- [x] Manual import UI; history and blocklist UI
- [x] Missing and cutoff-unmet search

**Status: ✅ done** and covered by integration tests against mocked indexers and clients. Not yet run against real qBittorrent/SABnzbd instances.

**Exit criteria:** End-to-end, adding a movie leads to an automatic search, grab, download, import, rename and history entry with no manual steps, over both qBittorrent (torrent) and SABnzbd (Usenet). A failed download leads to a blocklist entry and a new search.

### M5 — TV Series (Sonarr parity) *(weeks 16–22)*
- [x] Series/season/episode model; TMDB TV (+ optional TVDB) provider
- [x] Monitoring options, season pass, series types (standard/daily/anime)
- [x] Episode parsing and matching: multi-episode, season packs, daily, absolute numbering
- [ ] XEM/scene mapping sync — *XEM client and scene-numbering columns exist; the sync job that fills them is not written yet*
- [x] Series library, series detail, episode actions, TV naming tokens
- [x] Calendar (movies + TV) and iCal feed

**Status: ✅ done** except XEM sync. Not yet benchmarked on a 300-series library.

**Exit criteria:** Season packs, multi-episode files and anime absolute releases import correctly against the fixture suite, and a 300-series library refreshes in under 5 minutes.

### M6 — Requests & Discovery (Jellyseerr parity) *(weeks 20–26)*
- [x] Discover feeds, search with availability, media detail (request view)
- [x] Request flow, approvals, decline reasons, quotas, 4K requests (second profile/root set) — *4K availability is not tracked separately yet*
- [x] Jellyfin, Emby and Plex login and user import; OIDC
- [x] Roles and permissions UI; user profile page
- [x] Issues with comments
- [x] Requester-only UI mode

**Status: ✅ done.**

**Exit criteria:** A Jellyfin user logs in, requests a series' season 2, an admin approves, and the user is notified when it becomes available. Quotas are enforced.

### M7 — Integrations & Notifications *(weeks 24–28)*
- [x] Media server library refresh and availability sync
- [x] Notifiers: Discord, Telegram, Email, Pushover, Gotify, ntfy, Apprise, Webhook, Slack, Matrix, custom script
- [ ] Per-user notification preferences — *preferences are stored and editable, but request notifications still go to every notifier*
- [x] Import lists (TMDB, Trakt, IMDb, MDBList, Plex/Jellyfin watchlists)

**Status: ✅ done** except per-user notification delivery.

**Exit criteria:** Every event type can be delivered to every notifier, and watchlist items automatically become requests.

### M8 — Books (Readarr parity)
- [x] `MediaKind::Book` across library, requests, queue, history and root folders
- [x] Open Library metadata provider (+ optional Google Books / Hardcover), with caching
- [x] Authors, books, editions and series; monitoring options; ebook and audiobook formats per book
- [x] Book/audiobook release parser with its own fixture suite
- [x] Book quality profiles, search → grab, import with EPUB/M4B metadata and cover writing, naming tokens
- [x] Author library, author/book detail, add and import-library screens
- [x] Book requests in Discover (REQUEST_BOOK, quotas, auto-approve)
- [x] Audiobookshelf and Calibre-Web/Kavita library refresh

**Status: ✅ implemented**, with the gaps listed under [Current Progress](#current-progress). Not yet run against real services.

**Exit criteria:** An existing ebook and audiobook library imports with correct metadata, and requesting a book leads to an automatic search, grab, import and rename.

### M9 — Music (Lidarr parity)
- [x] `MediaKind::Music` across library, requests, queue, history and root folders
- [x] MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive provider, rate-limited and cached
- [x] Artists, release groups, releases and tracks; metadata profiles (album types); monitoring options
- [x] Music release parser with its own fixture suite (including discography packs)
- [x] Lossy/lossless quality profiles, search → grab, track matching, tag writing, naming tokens
- [x] Artist library, artist/album detail, release chooser, add and import-library screens
- [x] Album requests in Discover (REQUEST_MUSIC, quotas, auto-approve)
- [x] Navidrome library refresh; list imports (Last.fm, ListenBrainz, Spotify)

**Status: ✅ implemented**, with the gaps listed under [Current Progress](#current-progress). The 95% match rate hasn't been measured on a real library.

**Exit criteria:** A 20k-track library imports and matches at least 95% of albums automatically, and a requested album is searched, grabbed, tagged and imported with no manual steps.

### M10 — Migration, Compatibility & Hardening
- [ ] `reelix-migrate` for Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, Jellyseerr, Readarr and Lidarr
- [ ] Radarr/Sonarr v3 and Readarr/Lidarr v1 API shims (subset needed by Bazarr, Recyclarr, Homepage, LunaSea)
- [ ] Torznab aggregator endpoint
- [ ] PostgreSQL support and CI matrix
- [ ] Backups/restore, update checks, health checks complete
- [ ] Performance pass (10k movies / 2k series / 100k tracks fixtures), accessibility pass (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Security review, threat model, fuzzing on all parsers (XML, YAML, release names)

**Exit criteria:** A real user's full *arr stack migrates with no data loss, the performance targets are met, and there are no known critical bugs.

### M11 — 1.0 Release
- [ ] Documentation site (mdBook): install, migration, every setting, API, provider authoring guide
- [ ] Stable API v1 freeze and semver policy
- [ ] Release automation: changelog, multi-arch images, binaries, checksums, SBOM

### Post-1.0 Ideas
- Subtitles (Bazarr-like), using OpenSubtitles and others
- Smart cleanup rules (watched + age + rating → delete, with dry-run)
- Multiple instances (e.g. 4K) through profiles instead of separate installs (partly covered by 4K profiles in M6)
- Comics and manga
- Mobile PWA with push notifications
- Plugin system (WASM components) for third-party providers

## Testing Strategy

| Level | Tooling | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `cargo test`, `rstest`, `proptest` | Parser, decision specs, naming engine, quota math |
| Fixture/golden | `insta` snapshots | Release names → parsed output; naming previews; indexer XML → ReleaseInfo |
| Fuzz | `cargo-fuzz` | Release parser, Torznab XML, YAML definitions, filename matcher |
| Integration | `sqlx::test`, `wiremock` | Repos on SQLite and Postgres; indexer/client/metadata adapters against mocked HTTP |
| Contract | Recorded real responses | qBittorrent/SAB/Transmission API versions; TMDB payloads |
| Filesystem | temp dirs (`tempfile`), loopback FS for hardlink tests | Import modes, permissions, recycle bin, cross-device fallback |
| End-to-end | Playwright + docker-compose (Reelix + qBittorrent + SABnzbd + mock Torznab/Newznab indexers + Jellyfin) | Critical user journeys per milestone exit criteria |
| Performance | `criterion`, k6 for API | Parser throughput, library list endpoints, WS fan-out |

CI gates: fmt, clippy (pedantic where sensible), tests on Linux/macOS/Windows, `cargo deny` (licenses and advisories), coverage report (target ≥ 80% on core crates).

## Security

- Auth is required by default. A "disable auth for local addresses" option exists but is **off** by default.
- Passwords are hashed with argon2id. API keys are stored hashed. Sessions use HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite=Lax cookies.
- CSRF protection on cookie-authenticated state-changing requests.
- Provider secrets are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).
- Logins are rate-limited, with lockout back-off.
- Strict CSP headers. The UI loads no third-party scripts, and TMDB images go through an optional image proxy/cache.
- **Path safety:** every filesystem operation is restricted to configured root folders and download paths. Paths are canonicalized and symlink escapes rejected. Reelix never deletes outside its roots.
- Release-group, title and other external strings are always escaped in the UI. Custom-script notifications receive data through environment variables, never a shell-interpolated string.
- SSRF guard on user-supplied URLs (indexers, webhooks), with an opt-in to allow private IPs since most homelab targets are LAN.
- Dependency auditing in CI, plus signed releases and an SBOM.

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Idle memory | < 100 MB (10k movies, 2k series) |
| Cold start | < 1 s (excluding migrations) |
| Movie library page (10k items) API | < 150 ms p95 |
| UI first contentful paint | < 1.5 s on LAN |
| Release parse throughput | > 50k titles/s single core |
| Concurrent indexer search | 20 indexers, results streamed as they arrive, total bounded by slowest indexer timeout (default 30 s) |
| Queue poll overhead | < 1% CPU with 50 active downloads |
| Music library *(M9)* | 2k artists / 100k tracks without slowing the artist list (< 150 ms p95) |

---

## Observability

- Structured logs (`tracing`) to the console and rolling files, plus a UI log viewer with live tail.
- Optional `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint: job durations, queue depth, indexer latency/failures, HTTP latency and grabs/imports counters.
- Optional OpenTelemetry trace export.
- `/api/v1/system/health` for container healthchecks. It returns 200, or 503 when there are critical issues.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk

# Backend (API on :7700; migrations run automatically on startup, data in ./data)
cargo run -p reelix-server

# Frontend with hot reload (second terminal; :8080 proxies /api to :7700)
cd crates/reelix-web && trunk serve

# Or build the UI once and let the server host it at http://localhost:7700
(cd crates/reelix-web && trunk build --release) && cargo run -p reelix-server

# Tests
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy -p reelix-web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -- -D warnings
# Later milestones: cargo xtask fixtures check (parser golden tests), npx playwright test (e2e)

# Lint
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

A dev compose stack in `tests/e2e/compose.yml` brings up qBittorrent, SABnzbd, mock Torznab and Newznab indexers, and Jellyfin with sample media for local end-to-end work.

## Contributing

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat(indexers): add Deluge v2 support`).
- Open an issue or discussion before large features. Architecture changes need a short ADR in `docs/adr/`.
- New providers need an adapter, a settings schema, recorded fixtures, tests and docs.
- New parser cases go in as fixtures **before** the fix.

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Leaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Leptos vs. TypeScript SPA for the frontend | Leptos; re-evaluate at end of M1 |
| 2 | TMDB-only for TV, or require TVDB? | TMDB primary (free), TVDB optional for better anime/scene matching |
| 3 | Ship our own TMDB API key or require the user's? | Ship a default key, allow override |
| 4 | Indexer definitions: fork the Prowlarr/Jackett YAML catalog or maintain our own? | Consume the upstream catalog where licensing allows, with a compatibility layer |
| 5 | 4K handling: separate profiles/roots in one instance vs. linked instances | Single instance with a "4K" variant per movie/series |
| 6 | SQLite concurrency at scale (WAL mode + single writer task) vs. pushing Postgres | WAL + write-serialization; Postgres optional |
| 7 | Plugin system (WASM) timing | Post-1.0 |
| 8 | License: GPL-3.0 vs. AGPL-3.0 vs. MIT/Apache | See below |
| 9 | Book metadata source (Readarr's own source is no longer maintained) | Open Library by default; Google Books and Hardcover as optional providers |
| 10 | Ebooks and audiobooks: one book with two formats, or two separate libraries? | One book with per-format monitoring, profiles and root folders |
| 11 | MusicBrainz: call the public API directly, or run/offer a mirror? | Public API with aggressive caching; optional self-hosted mirror URL |
| 12 | Should audio tagging rewrite files that are still seeding? | No. Tag the imported copy only, and refuse to tag hardlinked files unless the user opts in |

## License & Legal

**License:** to be decided before the first public release. GPL-3.0 is the leading candidate, in line with the ecosystem and keeping the option to reuse GPL-licensed indexer definitions open.
